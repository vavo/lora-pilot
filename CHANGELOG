Version 1.9

- ControlPilot shutdown scheduler defaults to safe stop for local storage; remove/delete requires explicit RUNPOD_POD_SHUTDOWN=remove or RUNPOD_VOLUME_TYPE=network.
- Jupyter allow-origin defaults to RunPod proxy + localhost/127.0.0.1; add more with JUPYTER_ALLOW_ORIGIN_PAT.
- ControlPilot model sizing/deletes fixed for hf_repo and nested hf_file paths.
- modelsgui now honors /workspace/config/models.manifest when present.
- Fixed ComfyUI proxy httpx import issue - moved to module-level imports for localhost compatibility.
- TrainPilot log reader now scans /workspace/outputs/*/_logs/train.log for Kohya output.
- Added universal deployment support for ComfyUI live preview (RunPod + localhost).
- Fixed mixed content issues in ComfyUI integration for both environments.
- Major architectural refactor: Extracted services into modular structure (comfy.py, models.py, shutdown.py).
- Added comprehensive Docker Compose setup for local development with GPU/CPU/Dev modes.
- Added docker-compose-helper.sh script for easy container management.
- Added environment variable configuration (.env.example) for customization.
- Added health checks for local deployment and documented Compose resource-limit caveats.

Version 1.8

- updated InvokeAI to 6.10.0
- several UX fixes and improvements in Control Pilot
- addressed several critical security issues
- added shutdown scheduler to ControlPilot (schedule shutdown in X minutes/hours/days in Dashboard); supports pod with local storage, network volumes and local docker images. In order for shutdown schedule to work with pods using network volumes, env variable RUNPOD_VOLUME_TYPE must be set to "network" (RUNPOD_VOLUME_TYPE=network). 
!!!WARNING!!! Setting RUNPOD_VOLUME_TYPE to "network" will cause the pod to terminate (delete) when the shutdown schedule is triggered. Use only with pods with mounted network volumes.
