Version 2.0

- Added AI Toolkit (ostris/ai-toolkit) to the image by default.
- Added AI Toolkit UI (Next.js) on port 8675, managed by Supervisor and exposed in Docker Compose.
- AI Toolkit now uses workspace paths by default:
  - datasets: /workspace/datasets
  - outputs: /workspace/outputs/ai-toolkit
  - models: /workspace/models (e.g. /workspace/models/checkpoints)
- Added Node.js 20 install + UI build steps (controlled by INSTALL_AI_TOOLKIT_UI).
- Added AI Toolkit to ControlPilot Services (start/stop/logs + “Open” link).
- Removed the standalone Gradio training UI on port 7860 from the image (Node UI is the primary interface).
- Stabilized shared InvokeAI/AI Toolkit venv by pinning core ABI deps (numpy<2, pillow<11) and using an invoke-specific constraints file (avoids torch/diffusers/gradio churn).
- updated Makefile and Docker Compose files to reflect integrated changes
- updated Docs

Version 1.99

- Added ComfyUI-Downloader custom node to the image and workspace install path.
- ComfyUI user assets now mirror into the frontend static root to prevent 404s for user.css/userdata/templates.
- TrainPilot shows a real progress bar parsed from Kohya step logs (status no longer echoes raw log line).
- Headless TrainPilot stability fixes: corrected SRC_PATH/TRAIN_DIR logging and unbound variable crash.
- Models page redesign with card layout, inline filters, and click-to-copy model paths with truncation.
- New models added to models.manifest
- Docs section now renders markdown
- Changelog added to Docs

Version 1.9

- ControlPilot shutdown scheduler defaults to safe stop for local storage; remove/delete requires explicit RUNPOD_POD_SHUTDOWN=remove or RUNPOD_VOLUME_TYPE=network.
- Jupyter allow-origin defaults to RunPod proxy + localhost/127.0.0.1; add more with JUPYTER_ALLOW_ORIGIN_PAT.
- ControlPilot model sizing/deletes fixed for hf_repo and nested hf_file paths.
- modelsgui now honors /workspace/config/models.manifest when present.
- Fixed ComfyUI proxy httpx import issue - moved to module-level imports for localhost compatibility.
- TrainPilot log reader now scans /workspace/outputs/*/_logs/train.log for Kohya output.
- Added universal deployment support for ComfyUI live preview (RunPod + localhost).
- Fixed mixed content issues in ComfyUI integration for both environments.
- Major architectural refactor: Extracted services into modular structure (comfy.py, models.py, shutdown.py).
- Added comprehensive Docker Compose setup for local development with GPU/CPU/Dev modes.
- Added docker-compose-helper.sh script for easy container management.
- Added environment variable configuration (.env.example) for customization.
- Added health checks for local deployment and documented Compose resource-limit caveats.

Version 1.8

- updated InvokeAI to 6.10.0
- several UX fixes and improvements in Control Pilot
- addressed several critical security issues
- added shutdown scheduler to ControlPilot (schedule shutdown in X minutes/hours/days in Dashboard); supports pod with local storage, network volumes and local docker images. In order for shutdown schedule to work with pods using network volumes, env variable RUNPOD_VOLUME_TYPE must be set to "network" (RUNPOD_VOLUME_TYPE=network). 
!!!WARNING!!! Setting RUNPOD_VOLUME_TYPE to "network" will cause the pod to terminate (delete) when the shutdown schedule is triggered. Use only with pods with mounted network volumes.
