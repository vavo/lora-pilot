# LoRA Training 101

Welcome to LoRA Training 101! This comprehensive chapter covers everything you need to know about training custom LoRA models, from absolute basics to advanced techniques. Whether you want to create consistent characters, unique styles, or specialized concepts, this guide will take you there.

## Beginner Terms (Plain English)

- **Training**: teaching the model using your example images
- **LoRA**: the small file that stores what was learned
- **Steps**: how many training passes to run
- **Learning rate**: how big each training update is
- **Batch size**: how many images are processed together per update
- **VRAM**: your GPU memory
- **Precision (FP16/BF16)**: number format that affects speed and memory

##  Chapter Overview

This chapter is structured to help you master LoRA training progressively:
