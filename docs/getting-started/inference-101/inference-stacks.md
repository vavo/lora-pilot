# Inference Stacks

LoRA Pilot gives you two main inference paths: **ComfyUI** and **InvokeAI**.

## Quick Comparison

| Stack | Best For | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| ComfyUI | Building custom image flows step by step with visual blocks | More settings and setup to learn |
| InvokeAI | Fast image generation with a simpler guided interface | Less flexibility for very complex custom flows |

## Terms in Plain English

- **Block** (often called a *node*): one step, like loading a model or generating an image
- **Workflow**: several blocks connected in order
- **Preset**: saved settings you can reuse later

## Choose ComfyUI If

- You want to build your process visually, step by step
- You need more advanced or unusual multi-step generation
- You want to save and reuse your own custom workflows

## Choose InvokeAI If

- You want quick iteration from prompt to image
- You prefer cleaner screens and beginner-friendly defaults
- You are still learning core settings like steps, CFG, and sampler

## Practical Recommendation

Start with InvokeAI first. Move to ComfyUI when you clearly need custom multi-step control.
