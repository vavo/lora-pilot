# Inference 101

Welcome to Inference 101. This chapter is for people starting from zero who want predictable results without random guessing.

## Chapter Overview

Inference is the part where you generate images from a model. No training required. Just a clear process and repeatable settings.

### Learning Path

1. **[What is Inference?](what-is-inference.md)** - Core concepts in plain language
2. **[Inference Stacks](inference-stacks.md)** - ComfyUI vs InvokeAI in LoRA Pilot
3. **[Model Selection for Inference](model-selection-for-inference.md)** - Picking your base model and optional add-ons
4. **[Core Generation Settings](core-generation-settings.md)** - Steps, guidance strength, sampler, seed, and resolution
5. **[Inference Workflows](inference-workflows.md)** - A repeatable daily process
6. **[Performance Optimization](performance-optimization.md)** - Better speed and stability on your hardware
7. **[Troubleshooting Inference](troubleshooting-inference.md)** - Fixing common failures fast
8. **[Practical Inference Projects](practical-inference-projects.md)** - End-to-end examples

## Learning Goals

After this chapter, you will be able to:
- Choose between ComfyUI and InvokeAI for your use case
- Build a repeatable generation process
- Tune core settings without copy-pasting random internet presets
- Improve output quality while controlling runtime
- Debug bad outputs and runtime issues quickly

## Prerequisites

Recommended:
- [Stable Diffusion 101](../stable-diffusion-101/README.md)
- Basic understanding of models and LoRAs (covered there)

Optional but useful:
- [Datasets 101](../datasets-101/README.md)
- [LoRA Training 101](../loRA-training-101/README.md)

## Quick Start

If you only have 20 minutes:
1. Read [What is Inference?](what-is-inference.md)
2. Read [Core Generation Settings](core-generation-settings.md)
3. Run one of the [Practical Inference Projects](practical-inference-projects.md)
