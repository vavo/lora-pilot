# Stable Diffusion 101

Welcome to Stable Diffusion 101! This comprehensive chapter is designed for absolute beginners with zero or low knowledge of AI image generation. We'll take you from basic concepts to advanced techniques, covering all models available in LoRA Pilot.

## Beginner Terms (Plain English)

- **Model / Checkpoint**: the main "brain" that draws images
- **LoRA**: a small add-on that teaches one style/character/concept
- **VAE**: the part that affects final image clarity/colors
- **Sampler**: the method the model uses to build an image
- **CFG**: how strongly the model follows your prompt
- **Seed**: randomness number (same seed = similar result)

##  Chapter Overview

This chapter is structured to help you learn progressively:
