# Captioning and Tagging

_Last updated: 2026-07-06_

Effective captions and tags are the "instructions" that tell your AI model what to learn. This guide covers how to write compelling descriptions and tags that train excellent models.

##  Overview

### Why Captions Matter

Think of captions as the teacher's lesson plan:
- **Good Instructions**: Clear directions = student learns well
- **Poor Instructions**: Vague directions = student gets confused
- **Consistent Instructions**: Same terminology = student learns consistently

The more useful mental model is this: captions are control knobs. They tell the trainer which parts of the image are named, movable, and promptable later.

If every picture of your character has red hair and you caption "red hair" every time, you are teaching the model that red hair is a describable attribute. Later, you can ask for another hair color more easily. If you leave it uncaptioned, the model may treat red hair as part of the identity. That can be what you want for an identity LoRA, or the reason your character refuses to change. At least the failure has a cause.

For a character LoRA, caption the things you want to vary later: pose, outfit, background, expression, lighting, camera angle. Be careful with permanent identity details. For a style LoRA, caption subjects and scenes so the model learns the style across many subjects instead of memorizing one subject. For a product or object LoRA, caption context and angle changes so the object itself becomes the stable idea.

### The Captioning Formula

```
Clear Subject + Accurate Details + Style Information = Effective Caption
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                    ↓
"photo of person" + "with brown hair, blue eyes" + "in garden" = Clear, useful caption
```

##  Caption Writing Principles

### Be Specific and Descriptive

#### Subject Identification
- **Who/What**: Clearly identify the main subject
- **Age/Gender**: When relevant
- **Appearance**: Hair color, clothing, accessories
- **Unique Features**: Distinguishing characteristics

#### Descriptive Details
- **Clothing**: "wearing a blue summer dress" vs "has blue dress"
- **Accessories**: "with a silver necklace" vs "has necklace"
- **Actions**: "sitting on a bench" vs "is sitting"
- **Expressions**: "smiling gently" vs "is smiling"

#### Context Information
- **Location**: "in a sunlit garden" vs "outside"
- **Time/Weather**: "at sunset" vs "during daytime"
- **Environment**: "in a modern office" vs "outdoors"

### Be Accurate and Honest

#### Don't Exaggerate
- **Realistic Description**: Describe what's actually there
- **Avoid Fantasy**: Unless training for fantasy style
- **Honest Limitations**: Acknowledge limitations
- **Quality Focus**: Emphasize actual quality

#### Include Style Information
- **Art Style**: "oil painting style" when relevant
- **Photography Style**: "professional photography" when relevant
- **Lighting**: "dramatic lighting" when relevant
- **Mood**: "peaceful atmosphere" when relevant

##  Captioning Tools and Techniques

### Captioning Software

#### Professional Tools
- **Adobe Bridge**: Professional photo management
- **Adobe Lightroom**: Professional photo editing and management
- **Capture One**: Professional photo capture software
- **Photo Mechanic**: Professional photo metadata editing

#### Free Tools
- **XnView MP**: Free image management and tagging
- **DigiKam**: Free photo management
- **FastStone**: Free image converter and optimizer

#### AI-Assisted Captioning
- **WD14-style taggers**: Good for anime, illustration, and booru-style tags. The [SmilingWolf WD tagger](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SmilingWolf/wd-tagger) family is the common reference point.
- **BLIP-style captioners**: Good for natural language image descriptions and photo-like datasets. Hugging Face documents BLIP as an image-captioning model in the [Transformers BLIP docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/blip).
- **Manual review**: Still required. Auto-captioners miss important details, invent details, and use inconsistent wording. They are assistants, not witnesses under oath.

Use WD14-style tags when the target model and dataset benefit from tag vocabulary, as in anime or illustration workflows. Use BLIP-style captions when you want sentence-like descriptions for photos, products, scenes, or mixed realistic datasets. In both cases, edit the output before training.

### Captioning Techniques

#### Template-Based Captioning
- **Create Templates**: Standardized caption templates
- **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Use templates for consistency
- **Variable Substitution**: Use variables for common elements
- **Batch Processing**: Apply templates to multiple images

#### Progressive Refinement
- **First Draft**: Write basic caption
- **Add Details**: Incrementally add more detail
- **Review and Edit**: Review and improve captions
- **Final Polish**: Final polish for quality

## 💡 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Vague Descriptions

#### The Mistake
- **Thinking**: "person" is good enough
- **Reality**: AI needs specific details to learn effectively
- **Solution**: Be specific and descriptive

#### Examples
```
Vague: "person in park"
Better: "young woman sitting on park bench"
Best: "young woman with long brown hair, wearing a blue dress, sitting on a park bench on a sunny afternoon"
```

### Inconsistent Terminology

#### The Mistake
- **Thinking**: "close enough" is good enough
- **Reality**: Inconsistent terminology confuses model learning
- **Solution**: Use consistent terminology across all captions

#### Examples
```
Inconsistent: "person", "girl", "woman" used interchangeably
Better: Always use "woman" or "person" consistently
```

### Missing Information

#### The Mistake
- **Thinking**: "The AI will figure it out"
- **Reality**: Missing information leads to poor learning
- **Solution**: Include all relevant information in captions

#### Examples
```
Missing: "woman in office"
Better: "woman in modern office, sitting at desk, working on laptop"
```

### Poor Quality Descriptors

#### The Mistake
- **Thinking**: "good quality" is sufficient
- **Reality**: Quality descriptors help model learn better
- **Solution**: Include specific quality descriptors

#### Examples
```
Poor: "nice photo"
Better: "professional photography, sharp focus, good lighting, high quality"
```

##  Advanced Captioning Techniques

### Weighted Captions

#### Emphasis Syntax
- **Standard Emphasis**: `(word)` = 1.1x weight
- **Strong Emphasis**: `((word))` = 1.21x weight
- **Triple Emphasis**: `(((word)))` = 1.33x weight

#### De-emphasis Syntax
- **Standard De-emphasis**: `[word]` = 0.9x weight
- **Strong De-emphasis**: `((word))` = 0.81x weight
- **Triple De-emphasis**: `(((word)))` = 0.66x weight

#### Weighting Examples
```
Emphasize subject: "((beautiful woman)) with brown hair"
Emphasize style: "landscape, ((oil painting style))"
Emphasize quality: "high quality, sharp focus, ((professional photography))"
```

### Natural Language Prompts

#### Sentence Structure
- **Natural Language**: Write captions as natural sentences
- **Varied Sentence Structure**: Use different sentence structures
- **Conversational Style**: Write as if describing to a person
- **Contextual Information**: Include relevant context naturally

#### Examples
```
Natural: "A young woman with long brown hair is sitting on a park bench, enjoying the warm afternoon sunlight"
Conversational: "I see a young woman with long brown hair sitting on a park bench, and she seems to be enjoying the warm afternoon sunlight"
```

### Multi-Modal Prompts

#### Text + Image
- **Text-First**: Text description followed by image
- **Image-First**: Image followed by text description
- **Combined**: Both text and image provided to model

#### Examples
```
Text-First: "A young woman with long brown hair"
Image-First: [image]
Combined: "A young woman with long brown hair, [image]"
```
